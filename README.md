## Welcome to anankethon 2023!

This year features our first pre-release version for [`py-ananke-v0.0.0-alpha`](https://github.com/athob/py-ananke/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha), a new Python wrapper for the `ananke` pipeline [(Sanderson et al. 2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..246....6S). In this repository, you will find all the materials (except simulation data) that we are making available through the Flatiron binder for exploring the features of `py-ananke`.
